# Pulse
Pulse is a script hub for roblox.

It's pretty simple to use and should work on every exploit apart from Android and IOS.
In terms of executors, you should probably use Solara as that's what it was designed with, however it is not the best for performance or script executor by far.

## THIS HUB IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION
